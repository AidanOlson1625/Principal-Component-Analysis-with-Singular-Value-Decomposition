# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-Singular-Value-Decomposition

This project focuses on principal component analysis and includes a presentation slide deck, a research paper, and supplementary MATLAB code.

All relevant code and data matrices are located in the PCA folder. Setting your MATLAB directory to this folder will allow you to run the code and interact with the figures as needed.

The comprehensive paper, PCA_with_SVD_Paper.pdf, provides a detailed overview of the project.
